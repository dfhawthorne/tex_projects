\subsection{Key Result}
The authors argue that:\\

 These insights into the self-reinforcing nature of narrative constructions could potentially shed new light on our understanding of blind spots in organizational perception which are often seen as antecedents of organizational inertia. {\bf The existing literature defines organizational inertia as the inability to enact internal change in the face of significant external change} \ldots . Blind spots are usually attributed to selective (competitor) perception \ldots, to myopic managerial decisions \ldots  or to cognitive inertia of middle or top managers \ldots . Our focus on narrative and narrative constructions can potentially provide an additional perspective for our understanding of blind spots in organizations. As our analysis has shown, narratives are extremely powerful in shaping organizational dynamics and their self-amplifying process of constructing self-legitimizing truth claims can create blind spots. These blind spots are not the result of managerial myopia or simple selective attention but rather are a product of the self-referential nature of narrative constructions in organizations. {\bf Despite the existence of critical voices (from inside as well as outside) the organization is aware of, the self-legitimizing nature of the narrative construction creates a self-reinforcing feedback mechanism which implicitly confirms dominant assumptions.} The blindness is therefore not the outcome of a purposeful act of domination which silences the deviating voices, but rather results from the circumstance that the functioning mechanism of the narrative construction is systematically hidden. By forming a web of self-reinforcing narratives which are self-legitimizing they limit the organization’s ability to “see” new perspectives or ‘listen’ to other voices. {\bf Silencing or choosing to ignore these alternative perspectives would limit the capacity of organizations to engage in fundamental change. Our narrative analysis shows how organizations become wedded to routines that reinforce the existing organizational culture and the dominant ways of doing things, thus reinforce the status quo and limit the scope for organizational learning to support the process of organizational change \ldots}. These insights extend our current understanding of the role of frames of reference in organizational change \ldots by drawing attention to the way such frames of reference emerge and become self-reinforcing.\\

An organisation has a story that most members believe and repeat as to why the organisation exists and is successful. This dominant narrative is difficult to challenge because as the old saying goes: "You can't argue with success".\\
