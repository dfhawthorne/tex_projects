\section{Analysis of Kelly and Amburgey 1991}

Here I analyse the citations to \cite{kelly1991organizational}.\\

\subsection{Aldrich 1999}

The PDF provided was a scan of chapter 2 of the book, "Organizations Evolving" (\cite{aldrich1999organizations}). \\

I could not find any reference to \cite{kelly1991organizational}.\\

\subsection{Gold et al 2001}

Gold et al \cite{gold2001knowledge} refers to Kelly and Amburgey's paper as reference \#67 in the paper. The paper is not searchable. \\

Used as source of description for preconditions of knowledge management as capabilities and resources \cite[p.186]{gold2001knowledge}.\\

Another reference to capability and resource in organizational behaviour literature \cite[p.192]{gold2001knowledge}.\\

\textit{In particular, the organization should experience a learning effect in which it improves over time in its capabilities for creating value.} \cite[p.196]{gold2001knowledge}.\\

The results of \cite{kelly1991organizational} are neither challenged or confirmed in this paper by Gold et al. \\
